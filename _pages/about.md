Hi there! I am Hemasri Sai Lella.
======
I am a graduate student pursuing an M.Tech (Research) in the Department of Computer Science and Automation at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT TIrupati. I am currently working with [Prof. Jayant R. Haritsa](https://dsl.cds.iisc.ac.in/~haritsa/) at the [Database Systems Lab (DSL)](https://dsl.cds.iisc.ac.in/), IISc, where my work focuses on SQL query rewriting to improve query performance.

Previously, I worked with [Dr. Sridhar Chimalakonda](https://cse.iittp.ac.in/people/faculty/dr-sridhar-chimalakonda) at the [RISHA lab](https://rishalab.in/), where I developed DBJoules, a tool that focuses on empirically understanding the energy efficiency of modern databases under diverse query workloads.
